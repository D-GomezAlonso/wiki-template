# Distributor page 

A distributor page is a page that encapsules a wide concept, might explain it and links to article pages related to itself.

For example, let's say we have a a page Called "Herbivores". 
This page might explain what an herbivore is and then have a list with the pages that are listed under the herbivore tag.

In this example, the page "Herbivores" would be a distributor page.
